        <div class="subheading mb-5">UX Strategist</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4"> Everyone hates failure. As a UX Strategist, I work with businesses looking to not only prevent the failure of their products, but to create digital products that bring success to users and in turn reward the business. UX strategy consists of defining a problem that users face, coming up with solutions to their problems, and then creating the solution. Many businesses have great ideas, and they really do want to help their customers. But too often, many will just jump into creating the experience that they believe will best serve the customer. Working like this is a thing of the past. Given the competition and increasing number of alternatives today, businesses must work with their community of customers, not against them, to help ensure their success.

<br><br>

        Thatâ€™s where I come in. A UX strategist must be able to coordinate the inception, development, and hand off of digital products. This process starts in the brain, and ends up on a chosen digital medium. As a UX strategist, I always start out with a deep probe into the business itself and/ or any data that is available to me. I want to understand the business at its very core level: what industry are they in, who are their customers, what do they sell, how do customers make the choice to work with them, where do their customers come from, what does their current user experience look like from end-to-end, how do customers move through their current experience and many more key aspects of the business. From there I seek to understand the current snags within the experience, what the business feels like could be improved about their experience. Users are an integral part to this process, so gathering quantitative and qualitative data through usability testing, field studies, guerrilla research, card sorting, and mental model mapping are just some of the methods I have at my disposal to collect this data. The reason that gathering this data is so important is because we are designing for the user, not for ourselves. We want to make the product as easy for the user to achieve their goals as possible. Molding our product around the already developed mental models users carry around is a big must. The next step within the process is to start designing and getting feedback from users and internal stakeholders. As this process moves along, I keep in mind the development requirements, to make sure I donâ€™t overdesign or overcomplicate to the point of bloating the product. Handing off to a developer should always go smooth, and I do everything I can to make sure the process goes smoothly. 
<br><br>

        The goal of any UX project is to hit a predetermined key performance indicator. I work with internal stakeholders to make sure that we stay on track and hit these goals. To see some of my work, you can search for me on Behance.
